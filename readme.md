# Eloquent Guardian
Eloquent Guardian is a simple permissions system for your users. While there are many other packages for permissions, this one solves everything in the most eloquent way.

# Installation
Install the package:
```bash
$ composer require rennokki/guardian
```

If your Laravel version does not support package discovery, add this line in the `providers` array in your `config/app.php` file:
```php
Rennokki\Guardian\GuardianServiceProvider::class,
```

Publish the config file & migration files:
```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

Migrate the database:
```bash
$ php artisan migrate
```

Add the `HasPermissions` trait to your Eloquent model:
```php
use Rennokki\Guardian\Traits\HasPermissions;

class User extends Model {
    use HasPermissions;
    ...
}
```

# Types of permissions
* String Type is just a string, it's not related to any model. It is good for permissions that holds accessing abilities or features.
```php
$user->allow('access.dashboard');
```

* Global Type is related to a model, but not to a specific one. It can control any model with any ID if set.
```php
$user->allow('edit', Post::class);
```

* Global Specific Type is related to a specific model. It cannot control any other model than this specific one.
```php
$user->allow('edit', App\Post::class, 'post_id_here');
```

# Checking permissions
You can check permissions within the model using `can()`, `cannot()` or `cant()`.
```php
$user->can('access.dashboard');
$user->cannot('sell.products');
$user->cant('sell.products'); // alias to cannot()
```

If your user has a permission for an action on a model, it will have access to any model passed with any ID.
``php
$user->allow('view', \App\Flight::class);
$user->can('view', \App\Flight::class, 1); // true, can view flight with ID 1
```

# Allowing and Unprohibiting permissions
Allowing or Unprohibiting produces a grant access to that permission.
```php
$user->allow('cloning');
$user->unprohibit('cloning'); // same as allow
```

# Disallowing and Prohibiting permissions
Disallowing or Prohibiting permissions can be done whenever. The result will always be the same: a denied access.
```php
$user->disallow('commenting');
$user->prohibit('commenting'); // same as disallow
```

# Global Type over Specific Type
Let's say you have a `Post` class and the user is only allowed to edit or delete only his own posts. Using this way, whenever you check for a Global Type, it will return false, but not if you check for Specific Type.
```php
$user->allow('edit', Post::class, 'his_post_id');
$user->allow('delete', Post::class, 'his_post_id');

$user->can('edit', Post::class); // false
$user->can('edit', Post::class, 'his_post_id'); // true
```

If you allow the user to edit the `Post::class`, it will be able to edit any class, with any ID.
```php
$user->allow('edit', Post::class);
$user->can('edit', Post::class, 1); // true
```

# Middleware
You can use the methods within the model as-is, or you can use a middleware to filter permissions for the current authenticated user.

For this, you should add the middleware to your `$routeMiddleware` array from `app\Http\Kernel.php`
```php
'guardian' => \Rennokki\Guardian\Middleware\CheckPermission::class,
```

You can use it in your routes to filter permissions automatically and throw specific exceptions when something occurs.

* String Middleware
```php
Route::get('/admin', 'AdminController@ControlPanel')->middleware('guardian:access.adashboard');
```
* Global Type
```php
Route::post('/admin/products', 'AdminController@CreateProduct')->middleware('guardian:create,App\Product');
```
* Global Specific Type
```php
Route::patch('/admin/{post_id}', 'AdminController@EditPost')->middleware('guardian:edit,App\Post,post_id');
```

**Note: Instead of putting a specific Post ID, you have just to indicate where the ID of that model will be placed in the route URL.**

* `Rennokki\Guardian\Exceptions\PermissionException`, if the authenticated user doesn't have permissions.
* `Rennokki\Guardian\Exceptions\RouteException`, if the passed route parameter is non-existent.

You can access `permission()`, `modelType()` and `modelIdPlaceholder()` methods within the exception to handle your exception further.
